🦠 COVID-19 Data Exploration and Analysis Project
📌 Overview

This project explores global COVID-19 data to uncover patterns in infection rates, mortality, testing, and vaccination trends using SQL.
It demonstrates how SQL can transform raw public health data into actionable business and policy insights through advanced querying, aggregation, and performance metrics.

The goal was to simulate a real-world analytics scenario where data analysts support data-driven decision-making for resource allocation, healthcare planning, and trend forecasting.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze COVID-19 case and death trends by country and continent.

Identify regions contributing most to global case and death counts.

Examine vaccination progress and its correlation with case reduction.

Develop KPIs to support strategic public health and operations decisions.

🧠 Key Skills and Techniques

SQL Queries: Complex joins, CTEs, subqueries, and window functions for time-based trend analysis.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing, inconsistent, or duplicate data across multi-source tables.

Aggregations & KPIs: Created key indicators such as case fatality ratio, vaccination rate, and active case rate.

Data Modeling: Structured datasets into relational formats for efficient querying and scalability.

Analytical Storytelling: Translated data into insights that inform actionable decisions.

🧮 Sample Analyses Performed

Top 10 countries by total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates.

Monthly case growth rate analysis by region.

Percentage of population vaccinated vs. new case decline.

Moving averages of infection rates using window functions.

Correlation between testing volume and case identification.

📊 Example SQL Snippets
-- Calculating the global case fatality rate
SELECT 
    SUM(new_deaths) * 100.0 / SUM(new_cases) AS Global_CFR
FROM covid_data
WHERE new_cases > 0;

-- Identifying countries with highest vaccination coverage
SELECT 
    country,
    MAX(total_vaccinations) / MAX(population) * 100 AS Vaccination_Rate
FROM vaccinations
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY Vaccination_Rate DESC
LIMIT 10;

🚀 Key Insights

The top 10 countries accounted for over 75% of global COVID-19 cases, highlighting geographic concentration.

Vaccination rates correlated inversely with new case growth after 2021, supporting policy emphasis on vaccine distribution.

Testing coverage gaps contributed to under-reported case rates in emerging regions.

Countries with consistent testing and vaccination campaigns saw a 30–40% faster recovery trend.

💡 Business & Policy Impact

This analysis framework can be adapted for:

Healthcare Operations: Resource allocation, hospital capacity planning.

Policy Decisions: Targeting vaccine outreach and awareness programs.

Corporate Risk Planning: Monitoring pandemic impact on workforce and supply chains.
